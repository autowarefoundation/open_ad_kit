# Autoware Open AD Kit

The [Open AD Kit](https://www.autoware.org/autoware-open-ad-kit) is a collaborative project developed by the [Autoware Foundation](https://www.autoware.org/) and its member companies and alliance partners. It aims to bring software-defined best practices to the [Autoware project](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/) and to enhance the [Autoware ecosystem](https://www.autoware.org/autoware-members) and capabilities by partnering with other organizations that share the goal of creating software-defined vehicles.

The Open AD Kit utilizes Autoware components, which are built using the [ROS2 framework](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html), to create a practical application demonstrating how [SOAFEE](https://www.soafee.io/)'s vision of software-defined vehicles can be realized. ROS2, with its microservices architecture, provides the foundation for this effort. Open AD Kit application can also communicate with other containerized applications to support various functionalities, such as providing a bi-directional data pipeline and providing up-to-date maps to be consumed within the Open AD Kit application.
